# Project

The objective of this project is the creation of an ML model through neural networks that allow us to classify images.

As  dataset for this purpose we have 3 categories of animal images: 
1. Dogs 
2. Cats 
3. Gorillas 

Within this project we can find a data folder, divided between training and validation. And in turn subdivided by image class.
